# Aegis AI - Smart Patient Monitoring System

## üè• Project Overview

**Aegis AI** is an AI-Integrated Smart Patient Monitoring System that enhances patient recovery, safety, and emotional well-being through remote monitoring. Using advanced AI technologies, it predicts health trends and provides guidance, much like a human caregiver would.

This innovative software creates a personalized, evolving digital model of each patient, enabling predictive care, real-time interaction, and continuous companionship‚Äîminimizing the need for constant human supervision.

**Not just monitoring ‚Äî we predict, personalize, and emotionally support recovery with a smart, caring digital companion.**

### üéØ Problem Statement

Post-surgery patients often perform restricted movements unknowingly, which can delay recovery or cause serious complications. Traditional monitoring systems are reactive rather than proactive, and lack the emotional support component crucial for patient well-being.

### üí° Solution

Aegis AI addresses these challenges by:
- **Predictive Analysis**: Using computer vision and AI to detect potentially harmful movements before they cause damage
- **Personalized Care**: Creating individual patient profiles that adapt and learn over time
- **Emotional Support**: Providing companionship and encouragement through AI-powered interactions
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous surveillance with intelligent alerts and notifications
- **Remote Care**: Enabling healthcare providers to monitor multiple patients efficiently

```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Camera Access Denied**: Ensure webcam permissions are granted
- **Model Loading Errors**: Check internet connection for initial model download
- **API Key Issues**: Verify Gemini API key is valid and has sufficient quota

- **Data Not Loading**: Ensure Python script is running and generating JSON files

### Performance Optimization

- **GPU Acceleration**: Install CUDA-compatible PyTorch for faster processing
- **Model Caching**: Models are cached locally after first download
- **Image Quality**: Adjust capture resolution for better performance vs. quality balance

### Logs and Debugging

- **Python Logs**: Check console output from `python index.py`
- **Server Logs**: Monitor Express.js server console
- **Browser Console**: Check for frontend JavaScript errors
- **File Permissions**: Ensure write permissions for JSON data files
